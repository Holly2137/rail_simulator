This stringline diagram shows the movements of trains on the route plotted over time and space. 

Existing services are represented by black lines.

The yellow lines represent the optimised feasable morning and evening services obtained by repeated testing at minute intervals over selected periods. 

Red lines represent a test group where no feasable solution was determined without modification to the existing services.
