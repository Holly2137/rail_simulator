This table summarises the performance of selected feasible test services from the stringline diagram. It lists each trainâ€™s departure and arrival time, total journey duration, delay, full runtime, and enforced wait time, which refers to time spent waiting to pass another train, not including scheduled stops.

For the morning service, T36 and T64 are the most suitable options. They performed efficiently, with minimal delays, and match the preferred arrival window of 8:00 to 9:00, based on survey responses from 529 participants. The 8:11 and 8:37 arrivals allow time for onward travel to major workplaces before 9:00. T3 is slightly too early and includes longer runtime and more waiting, while T90 arrives too late to turn around for the 09:05 Dublin service, making it less practical.

For the evening, TE36 at 21:05 is the most suitable option. Its timing complements existing departures at 17:05 and 19:05, creating a simple and consistent evening pattern that benefits both passengers and operations.
